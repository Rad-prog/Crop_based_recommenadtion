üå± Crop Recommendation System

This is a mini machine learning project that recommends the most suitable crop for cultivation based on soil and environmental parameters. The model is trained using the Random Forest Classifier and predicts the best crop to grow for given conditions.

üöÄ Project Description

Agriculture plays a vital role in food security, but farmers often face challenges in deciding which crop is best suited for their soil and climate conditions. This project aims to solve that by building a crop recommendation system.

Input parameters:

Nitrogen (N)

Phosphorus (P)

Potassium (K)

Temperature

Humidity

pH value

Rainfall

Output:

The most suitable crop (e.g., rice, maize, mango, wheat, cotton, etc.)

The model uses a Random Forest Algorithm, which gives high accuracy due to its ensemble learning approach.

‚öôÔ∏è Tech Stack

Programming Language: Python

Libraries Used:

Pandas, NumPy (Data handling)

Matplotlib, Seaborn (Visualization)

Scikit-learn (Machine Learning - Random Forest)

Dataset: Crop Recommendation Dataset (contains soil and weather data for different crops)

üìä Workflow

Data Preprocessing & Cleaning

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Feature Selection & Engineering

Model Training using Random Forest

Model Evaluation (Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, Classification Report)

Saving the trained model (model.pkl)

Building a simple UI / script to predict crop from user inputs

üéØ Results

Achieved high accuracy with Random Forest Classifier.

Provides real-time prediction of the best crop to grow based on given input conditions.

üì¶ How to Run
